# pig-game
A simple dice game I made during the JavaScript course by Jonas. 
Purpose was to PRACTICE JavaScript. Style and HTML are 95% taken from the course (CopyRight by Jonas).

There are 2 .js files: 
1. script1 - is my first coding file, where I was just trying to make the game work, the code is not DRY. 
2. script - is my second coding file and the final one, where I refactored the code and made it modular.
